# React Event System Example

Demo for comparing React ``Synthetic Event`` and DOM ``Native Event`` handling.

Because the React ``Synthetic`` events are different from the DOM ``Native`` events, I'll do the experiments in the following:

1. DOM Native Events Propagation with ``Capture`` phase
2. DOM Native Events Propagation with ``Bubble`` phase
3. React ``Synthetic`` Events with ``setState``
4. React ``Synthetic`` Events with Redux ``actions``
5. React ``Synthetic`` Events, ``setState`` and DOM Native Events
6. React ``Synthetic`` Events, Redux ``actions`` and DOM Native Events
